# SULI_fermilab_M4_analysis
Code created by Trevor Loe as a 2022 SULI intern at Fermilab under Dr. Diktys Stratakis. This code is developed for data analysis of the first commisioning of the Fermilab Muon Campus M4 line in May 2022. Actual data is not included as that is property of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

## Paper
A paper was published based on the analysis done by this code on April 5, 2023, which can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/18/04/P04005).

## G4beamline files
The G4beamline folder contains all files used to run and analyze the G4beamline simulation. G4beamline is a free Geant4-based simulation; more info on it can be found [here](https://www.muonsinc.com/Website1/G4beamline). For this project, it was run from the command line. The ```.g4bl``` files used to run the simulation have been removed as they are the property of Fermilab. Data from the simulations is stored in the text files (VD_Diagnostic for the virtual detectors and MW___ for the real detectors simulated).
